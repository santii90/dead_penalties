# dead_penalties
S.T.A.L.K.E.R G.A.M.M.A Addon

 I'm putting together a mod based on the idea of having some "penalties" when dying, not exactly like ironman because it's not a full progress restart, I have been thinking about something like this for some time and Klean's idea of a hideout aka EFT and drop a backpack with your items when dying made me dive into it. I have found some mods but no one had everything I wanted. This is my first time modding so I used Minecraft_Respawn code as a baseline for the project, so thanks to RavenAscendant for that.
